# DevContainerPythonTemplate
This is a Dev Container Python Template that can be used as a base for a DevSecOp's environment

You can use this in Githubs Codespaces or cloning the repository and running it in vscode (as a devcontainer)

Examples of Codespace Below:

![Example 1]("/assets for README.MD/image.png")

![Example 2]("/assets for README.MD/image.png")

If you choose to use this container, you can safely remove "assets for README.MD" folder and the README.md file
